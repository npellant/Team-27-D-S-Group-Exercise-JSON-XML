# Team-27-D-S-Group-Exercise-JSON-XML

#JSON would be easiest to use for a computer as the data is serialized such that the machine does not have to read information that would otherwise be in a columnar format as CSV might be. JSON is also a preferred alternative to XML as it has a lower machine run-time.Â 

#CSV would be easiest to use as a human because it is in a columnar format that we are used to seeing (such as in Excel files) and is more readable because of this organization style.
